$lang['ABOUT_TEXT'] = 'The FERMI project was initiated by the Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF) in December 2014. It has the twofold goal of: <p> &bull; Collecting information on high-level internships for physics students available both in Italy and abroad.</p> <p> &bull; Promoting the creation of new internship opportunities in Italian universities, laboratories and research centers.</p> This webpage contains the FERMI Project database of internships and summer schools for physics students, collected over the last months. They are classified according to many parameters (field of research, country, region, paid/unpaid, period of the year, etc.) for your convenience.   <p> Research internships are incredible opportunities to work hands on alongside experts in your chosen field, putting in practice the theoretical knowledge one gathered during courses at universities to tackle challenging problems in a creative and original fashion. They can be great fun too! Some of the most well-established internship programs (for example, the CERN summer research internship or the SURF fellowship at Caltech) offer a very rich social program! You’ll be meeting dozens of other interesting and motivated students from around the world, creating strong bonds and having lots of fun! </p> Even in programs with a smaller number of participants, the atmosphere is usually stimulating and nurturing, and professors as well as PhD students are often very eager to involve the newcomers in the life of the research group! Have a look at the opportunities we collected here for you and in case you’d like to suggest an addition to the database, do not hesitate to contact Lucio Milanese, the FERMI Project Coordinator, at lucio.milanese@ai-sf.it';
$lang['ABOUT_OFFLINE'] ='Database offline: We thought an offline copy of the database would be useful so we compiled all the opportunities in a document you can download here';
$lang['ABOUT_FILTER'] ='Filters: Our database allows you to search efficiently by using filters. They are: Field of physics, Period, Retribution, Location, Level of studies, Quality.';

$lang['HOME_OBJECTIVE'] ='Building a database of internships and opportunities for physics students and help them getting into contact with research institutes.';
$lang['HOME_HOW'] ='The database allows you to do tailor made searches by field of study, place, retribution and many more';
$lang['HOME_TARGET'] ='Young physics students, especially Italian but not restricted.';

$lang['CONTRIBUTE_TEXT'] = 'We created the form included in this page to give you an opportunity to directly contribute to the growth of the “FERMI" project! Please let us know about any internship program for physics students you’re aware of if it’s not already included in the database (internships based at a university, research laboratory or private company are all fine!). Suggestions of entries for summer/winter schools are also welcome!';

$lang['FOOTER'] ='The Associazione Italiana Studenti di Fisica (AISF) gathers together all the Italian students of physics. It was founded in Heidelberg in August 2014 and since January 2015 is a National Committee for the International Associazion of Physics Students (IAPS).';

$lang['WELCOME'] = 'The FERMI project of the Italian Association of Physics Students aims to build a database of internships and opportunities for physics students as these can make a difference in a world with such a high competition for jobs or research positions. We think that stages in research institutes and universities are excellent to define our academic interests and get to know diverse and stimulating realities.';

$lang['PROMOTION'] = 'You can help us grow the FERMI database! If you know good internship programs that are not listed in the database, just send us an email. Do not hesitate to write to Lucio Milanese, the FERMI project coordinator, at lucio.milanese@ai-sf.it.';
